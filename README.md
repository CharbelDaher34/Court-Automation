## Auto-Court Project

### Introduction

In the dynamic environment of sports courts and similar service establishments, efficient management and smooth operations are paramount. Traditionally, many facilities rely on outdated methods involving phone reservations, handwritten notes, and physical agendas to schedule and reserve appointments. This manual process often leads to inefficiencies, overcrowding, and mismanagement, ultimately affecting the user experience.

Our project aims to revolutionize the management and access of sports courts by leveraging modern technology. By automating major aspects of the reservation and management process, we seek to enhance operational efficiency and provide a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

### Project Components

1. **Website for Court Reservation**:
   - A user-friendly website allows customers to browse and reserve courts, providing real-time availability and reducing the need for phone-based reservations.

2. **Windows Form Application for Admin Management**:
   - A comprehensive application for administrators to manage client information, court details, and reservation schedules, streamlining administrative tasks and ensuring efficiency.

3. **Arduino-Based Court Management System**:
   - An automated system to manage court access and lighting, ensuring smooth operations and enhancing user convenience through IoT technology.

### Features and Technologies

- **Web Application**: Built using Python and Django framework, facilitating online reservations and user interactions.
- **Admin Application**: Developed in C#, allowing efficient management of client data, court schedules, customer reviews, inventory, and food stock.
- **Database**: MySQL database to manage information about clients, courts, reservations, and other relevant data, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.
